# Next.js + Tailwind CSS first approach

This is the first project that I made with NextJS + Tailwind going to
deep with this tools. The site was designed by my best friend who is a graphic
designer: I only followed the design and take it from the Adobe XD project to 
the web.

This project will contain more functionals in a future, for now is only a landing page.
NextJS, as React does, allow us to scale the projects made with it, but 
for SPA is the best choice in the beggining.

You can see the current version of the project in action [here](https://dani-briefcase.vercel.app)!
